2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_2 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_2 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_2 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.015 ns between design_1_i/rst_ps7_0_102M/U0/ACTIVE_LOW_PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER_N/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/sample_generator_0/U0/data_in_signal_reg[0]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_2). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.015 ns between design_1_i/rst_ps7_0_102M/U0/ACTIVE_LOW_PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER_N/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/sample_generator_0/U0/data_in_signal_reg[1]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_2). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
